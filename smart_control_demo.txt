You could send a WM_MOUSEWHEEL message to do what you want. For example, to scroll down once in a new notepad window using C++:

HWND hwnd = FindWindowEx(FindWindow(NULL, "Untitled - Notepad"), NULL, "Edit", NULL);
RECT r;
GetClientRect(hwnd, &r);
SendMessage(hwnd, WM_MOUSEWHEEL, MAKEWPARAM(0, WHEEL_DELTA * -1), MAKELPARAM(r.right / 2, r.bottom / 2));
To adapt that to C#, you could do something such as this:

[DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto)]
static extern IntPtr SendMessage(IntPtr hWnd, UInt32 Msg, Int32 wParam, ref Point lParam);

private void ScrollWindow(IntPtr hwnd, Point p, int scrolls = -1)
{
    SendMessage(hwnd, WM_MOUSEWHEEL, (WHEEL_DELTA * scrolls) << 16, ref p);
}
Which could be used to scroll down once in a new notepad window like this:

//Imports
[DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
static extern IntPtr FindWindow(string lpClassName, string lpWindowName);

[DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
static extern IntPtr FindWindowEx(IntPtr hwndParent, IntPtr hwndChildAfter, string lpszClass, string lpszWindow);
...
//Actual code
IntPtr hwnd = FindWindowEx(FindWindow(null, "Untitled - Notepad"), IntPtr.Zero, "Edit", null);
Point p = new Point(0, 0);
ScrollWindow(hwnd, p);
Some programs will require the lParam sent to be a point that's actually above the scrolled area, while others such as notepad will not.

Finding information about this seems to be kinda hard. Your example worked great by the way. Since you seems to be one of the few I have seen that knows this, where do you get this information? I would like to generalize this more, so it works on more than just notepad. Im not sure where "Edit" comes from. Whats that? How can I find equivalents for other programs? – Kim Smith Mar 13 '13 at 22:56
  	 	
The "Edit" is the control in notepad that you need to send the scroll to. Many browsers won't require it to be sent to a control - for example, I tried with just FindWindow(null, "Current Page Name - Opera"); and scrolling worked fine. I have used WM_MOUSEWHEEL in the past, and know what is required for it due to using it in a low level mouse hook. If you want to get a control that it needs to be sent to in other windows, either look into EnumChildWindows or just use WinSpy++.

Also, if you need horizontal scrolling, the WM_MOUSEHWHEEL message should work. – Jammerx2 Mar 14 '13 at 20:27
  	 	
Thanks Jammerx2. This is very helpful. – Kim Smith Mar 28 '13 at 17:11
